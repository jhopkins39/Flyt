This is the new networking app
It is set up with Google's firebase, so you will make an account,
sign in, and create a profile.  After this you can swipe through
people's profiles to be match or ignore them.

Right now its best run on either an iOS simulator or android emulator.

It is just the basic app, so its pretty rough, and fucntionality can still be added.
